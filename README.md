# NexWave-Financial

------

Hey there! Welcome to my personal project, NexWave Financial. I'm diving into iOS development and brushing up on my Django skills through this endeavor. Here's a breakdown of what I'm working on:

## What I'm Building

NexWave Financial is like a virtual bank tailored for international students. I'm crafting a mobile app that lets users handle their finances conveniently. Here's what it can do:

- **Log In**: Users can sign in using their email. To keep everything secure, I'm implementing JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for session handling.

- **Manage Money**: Users can perform transactions, check their transaction history, and monitor their account balances.

- **Send and Receive Money**: It's easy for users to send money to others and receive money from them using the app.

- **Stay Secure**: I'm adding PIN or Face ID authentication options to ensure that only authorized users can access their accounts.

## What I'm Using

To bring this project to life, I'm leveraging a few technologies:

- **Django Rest Framework**: This is my go-to tool for building the backend API. It handles user authentication and transaction management.

- **PostgreSQL**: I'm relying on PostgreSQL, a robust relational database management system for storing user data securely.

- **SwiftUI**: I'm using SwiftUI for the iOS app to create a sleek and user-friendly interface. It offers modern design options and simplifies the development process.
